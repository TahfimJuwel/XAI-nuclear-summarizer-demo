    EVENT NOTIFICATION: 45738
    LICENSEE: XYZ ENERGY
    SITE: OAK CREEK NUCLEAR PLANT
    DOCKET: 05000400
    EVENT DATE: 03-15-2024

    EVENT DESCRIPTION:
    At 14:22 EST, an automatic reactor trip occurred on Unit 1 from 100% power. The trip was initiated by a main turbine trip signal. The turbine trip was caused by a loss of the 'A' Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) due to a failure of its associated electrical breaker. All control rods fully inserted as designed, and the reactor was successfully shut down.

    Following the trip, the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system automatically initiated to provide cooling to the steam generators, as is the standard procedure. However, the 'B' train of the AFW system failed to start. The 'A' and 'C' trains of the AFW system started successfully and are providing adequate decay heat removal. The 'B' AFW pump is currently under investigation by maintenance personnel. Plant operators responded appropriately and stabilized the plant in a hot shutdown condition.

    SAFETY ASSESSMENT:
    There was no release of radioactive material to the environment. All safety systems responded as expected, with the exception of the 'B' AFW pump. The redundant 'A' and 'C' AFW trains are fully functional and sufficient for maintaining the plant in a safe state. The event is classified as a Non-Emergency event under the NRC's emergency classification system. The health and safety of the public were not affected. The licensee will conduct a full root cause analysis for both the MFP breaker failure and the AFW pump failure.
